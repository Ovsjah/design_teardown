## About
In this simple project, I’ll be breaking apart the website for a popular design magazine with which you’re probably familiar by now – [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/). The goal for this exercise is to start training myself to think in terms of visual hierarchy, typography and design principles.

I created a grayscale heat map of the website that indicates which elements have the greatest weight in the visual hierarchy.
